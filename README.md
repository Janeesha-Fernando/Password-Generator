# Password-Generator
Generate strong &amp; secure passwords for all your online accounts with our Virgil Password Generator.The longer a password, the more secure it is. A strong password should be at least 10 characters long.
Strong passwords use a combination of letters, numbers, cases, and symbols to form an unpredictable string of characters that doesn't resemble words or names.
A strong password should be unique to each account to reduce vulnerability in the event of a hack.
